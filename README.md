# 🚗 Park It Here

## Why this tool?

When I park in large malls or apartment complexes, I used to take a photo of my parking spot with my phone.
Those photos kept syncing to the cloud and piling up in my camera roll, and later it was annoying to scroll through a gallery full of parking photos just to find other pictures.

To avoid cluttering my photo library and cloud storage, I made a tool where the **browser remembers the parking location for me using local storage**. No more cloud sync, no more extra parking photos in the gallery.
