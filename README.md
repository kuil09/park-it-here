## Why this tool?

When I park in large malls or apartment complexes, I used to take a photo of my parking spot with my phone.
Those photos kept syncing to the cloud and piling up in my camera roll, and later it was annoying to scroll through a gallery full of parking photos just to find other pictures.

To avoid cluttering my photo library and cloud storage, I made a tool where the **browser remembers the parking location for me using local storage**. No more cloud sync, no more extra parking photos in the gallery.

With **Park It Here**:

- You can **save your parking location with a simple photo from the browser**
- **GPS coordinates are captured** and displayed on OpenStreetMap (no API key required!)
- The photo is stored **only in your browser's local storage**, not in the cloud
- You don't install any apps — just open the website and **check where you parked**
